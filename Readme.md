# Axon

  Axon is a message-oriented socket library for node.js heavily inspired by zeromq.

## Installation

    $ npm install axon

## Features

  - message oriented
  - automated reconnection
  - light-weight wire protocol
  - supports arbitrary binary message (msgpack, json, BLOBS, etc)
  - supports JSON messages out of the box

## Patterns

  - push / pull
  - pub / sub
  - req / rep
  - pub-emitter / sub-emitter

## Push / Pull

`PushSocket`s distribute messages round-robin:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('push');

sock.bind(3000);
console.log('push server started');

setInterval(function(){
  sock.send('hello');
}, 150);
```

Receiver of `PushSocket` messages:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('pull');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(msg){
  console.log(msg.toString());
});
```

Both `PushSocket`s and `PullSocket`s may `.bind()` or `.connect()`. In the
following configuration the push socket is bound and pull "workers" connect
to it to receive work:

![push bind](http://f.cl.ly/items/473u3m1a0k1i0J0I3s04/ss-push.png)

This configuration shows the inverse, where workers connect to a "sink"
to push results:

![pull bind](http://f.cl.ly/items/3Y0j2v153Q0l1r373i0H/ss-pull.png)

## Pub / Sub

`PubSocket`s send messages to all subscribers without queueing. This is an
important difference when compared to a `PushSocket`, where the delivery of
messages will be queued during disconnects and sent again upon the next connection.

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('pub');

sock.bind(3000);
console.log('pub server started');

setInterval(function(){
  sock.send('hello');
}, 500);
```

`SubSocket` simply recieves any messages from a `PubSocket`:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('sub');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(msg){
  console.log(msg.toString());
});
```

## Req / Rep

`ReqSocket` is similar to a `PushSocket` in that it round-robins messages
to connected `RepSocket`s, however it differs in that this communication is
bi-directional, every `req.send()` _must_ provide a callback which is invoked
when the `RepSocket` replies.

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('req');

req.bind(3000);

req.send(img, function(res){
  
});
```

`RepSocket`s receive a `reply` callback that is used to respond to the request,
you may have several of these nodes.

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('rep');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(img, reply){
  // resize the image
  reply(img);
});
```

 Like other sockets you may provide multiple arguments or an array of arguments,
 followed by the callbacks. For example here we provide a task name of "resize"
 to facilitate multiple tasks over a single socket:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('req');

req.bind(3000);

req.send('resize', img, function(res){
  
});
```

`RepSocket`s receive a `reply` callback that is used to respond to the request,
you may have several of these nodes.

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('rep');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(task, img, reply){
  switch (task.toString()) {
    case 'resize':
      // resize the image
      reply(img);
      break;
  }
});
```

## PubEmitter / SubEmitter

  `PubEmitter` and `SubEmitter` are higher-level `Pub` / `Sub` sockets, using the "json" codec to behave much like node's `EventEmitter`.

app.js:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('pub-emitter');

sock.connect(3000);

setInterval(function(){
  sock.emit('login', { name: 'tobi' });
}, 500);
```

logger.js:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('sub-emitter');

sock.bind(3000);

sock.on('login', function(user){
  console.log('%s signed in', user.name);
});
```

## Req / Rep

`ReqSocket`s send and receive messages, queueing messages on remote disconnects. There
is no "lock step" involved, allowing messages sent later to receive replies prior to
previously sent messages. `RepSocket`s reply to received messages, there is no concept of `send()`. Each
received message will have a `reply` callback, which will send the response back to the remote peer:

client.js
```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('req');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(msg){
  console.log('got: %s', msg.toString());
});

setInterval(function(){
  sock.send('ping');
}, 150);
```

server.js
```js

var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('rep');

sock.bind(3000);

sock.on('message', function(msg, reply){
  console.log('got: %s', msg.toString());
  reply('pong');
});
```

## Socket Options

Every socket has associated options that can be configured via `get/set`.

  - `identity` - The "name" of the socket that uniqued identifies it.
  - `retry timeout` - The amount of time until retries will not be attempted again.

PubSockets additionally have options for batching:

  - `batch max` - Max amount of messages to buffer in memory.
  - `batch ttl` - Amount of time to buffer messages before sending.

## Binding / Connecting

In addition to passing a portno, binding to INADDR_ANY by default, you
may also specify the hostname via `.bind(port, host)`, another alternative
is to specify the url much like zmq via `tcp://<hostname>:<portno>`, thus
the following are equivalent:

```
sock.bind(3000)
sock.bind(3000, '0.0.0.0')
sock.bind('tcp://0.0.0.0:3000')

sock.connect(3000)
sock.connect(3000, '0.0.0.0')
sock.connect('tcp://0.0.0.0:3000')
```

## Protocol

The wire protocol is simple and very much zeromq-like, where `<length>` is
a BE 24 bit unsigned integer representing a maximum length of roughly ~16mb. The `<meta>`
data byte is currently only used to store the codec, for example "json" is simply `1`,
in turn JSON messages received on the client end will then be automatically decoded for
you by selecting this same codec.

```
 octet:     0      1      2      3      <length>
        +------+------+------+------+------------------...
        | meta | <length>           | data ...
        +------+------+------+------+------------------...
```

Thus 5 bytes is the smallest message axon supports at the moment. Later if
necessary we can use the meta to indicate a small message and ditch octet 2 and 3
allowing for 3 byte messages.

## Codecs

To define a codec simply invoke the `axon.codec.define()` method, for example
here is the JSON codec:

```js
var axon = require('axon');

axon.codec.define('json', {
  encode: JSON.stringify,
  decode: JSON.parse
});
```

__Note:__ codecs must be defined on both the sending and receiving ends, otherwise
axon cannot properly decode the messages. You may of course ignore this
feature all together and simply pass encoded data to `.send()`.

## Performance

I haven't profiled or tuned anything yet but so far for on my macbook pro.

64 byte messages:

```

      min: 22,085 ops/s
     mean: 585,944 ops/s
   median: 606,176 ops/s
    total: 326,7126 ops in 6.5s
  through: 35.76318359375 mb/s

```

  1k messages:

```

      min: 1,851 ops/s
     mean: 34,0156 ops/s
   median: 449,660 ops/s
    total: 329,831 ops in 4.241s
  through: 332.18359375 mb/s

```

## What's it good for?

  Axon are not meant to combat zeromq nor provide feature parity,
  but provide a nice solution when you don't need the insane
  nanosecond latency or language interoperability that zeromq provides
  as axon do not rely on any third-party compiled libraries.

## Running tests

```
$ npm install
$ make test
