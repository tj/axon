# Axon

  Axon is a message-oriented socket library for node.js heavily inspired by zeromq.

## Installation

    $ npm install axon

## Features

  - message oriented
  - automated reconnection
  - light-weight wire protocol
  - light-weight implementation (~300 SLOC)
  - supports arbitrary binary message (msgpack, json, BLOBS, etc)
  - supports JSON messages out of the box
  - push / pull pattern
  - pub / sub pattern
  - event emitter pattern

## Push / Pull

`PushSocket`s distribute messages round-robin:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('push');

sock.bind(3000);
console.log('push server started');

setInterval(function(){
  sock.send('hello');
}, 150);
```

Receiver of `PushSocket` messages:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('pull');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(msg){
  console.log(msg.toString());
});
```

Both `PushSocket`s and `PullSocket`s may `.bind()` or `.connect()`. In the 
following configuration the push socket is bound and pull "workers" connect
to it to receive work:

![push bind](http://f.cl.ly/items/473u3m1a0k1i0J0I3s04/ss-push.png)

This configuration shows the inverse, where workers connect to a "sink"
to push results:

![pull bind](http://f.cl.ly/items/3Y0j2v153Q0l1r373i0H/ss-pull.png)

## Pub / Sub

`PubSocket`s send messages to all subscribers without queueing:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('pub');

sock.bind(3000);
console.log('pub server started');

setInterval(function(){
  sock.send('hello');
}, 500);
```

`SubSocket` provides selective reception of messages from a `PubSocket`:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('sub');

sock.connect(3000);

sock.on('message', function(msg){
  console.log(msg.toString());
});
```

## EmitterSocket

`EmitterSocket`'s send and receive messages behaving like regular node `EventEmitter`s.
This is achieved by using pub / sub sockets behind the scenes, automatically assigned
the "json" codec. Currently we simply choose define the `EmitterSocket` as a `PubSocket` if you `.bind()`, and `SubSocket` if you `.connect()`, providing the natural API you're used to:

server.js:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('emitter');

sock.bind(3000);
console.log('pub server started');

setInterval(function(){
  sock.emit('login', { name: 'tobi' });
}, 500);
```

client.js:

```js
var axon = require('axon')
  , sock = axon.socket('emitter');

sock.connect(3000);
console.log('sub client connected');

sock.on('login', function(user){
  console.log('%s signed in', user.name);
});
```

## Protocol

  The wire protocol is simple and very much zeromq-like, where `<length>` is
  a BE 24 bit unsigned integer representing a maximum length of roughly ~16mb. The `<meta>`
  data byte is currently only used to store the codec, for example "json" is simply `1`,
  in turn JSON messages received on the client end will then be automatically decoded for
  you by selecting this same codec.

```
 octet:     0      1      2      3      <length>
        +------+------+------+------+------------------...
        | meta | <length>           | data ...
        +------+------+------+------+------------------...
```

  Thus 5 bytes is the smallest message super sockets supports at the moment. Later if
  necessary we can use the meta to indicate a small message and ditch octet 2 and 3 
  allowing for 3 byte messages.

## Codecs

  To define a codec simply invoke the `ss.codec.define()` method, for example
  here is the JSON codec:

```js
var axon = require('axon');

axon.codec.define('json', {
  encode: JSON.stringify,
  decode: JSON.parse
});
```

  __Note:__ codecs must be defined on both the sending and receiving ends, otherwise
  super sockets cannot properly decode the messages. You may of course ignore this
  feature all together and simply pass encoded data to `.send()`.

## Performance

  I haven't profiled or tuned anything yet but so far for on my macbook pro.

64 byte messages:

```

      min: 22,085 ops/s
     mean: 585,944 ops/s
   median: 606,176 ops/s
    total: 326,7126 ops in 6.5s
  through: 35.76318359375 mb/s

```

  1k messages:

```

      min: 1,851 ops/s
     mean: 34,0156 ops/s
   median: 449,660 ops/s
    total: 329,831 ops in 4.241s
  through: 332.18359375 mb/s

```

## What's it good for?

  Axon is not meant to combat zeromq nor provide feature parity,
  but provide a nice solution when you don't need the insane
  nanosecond latency or language interoperability that zeromq provides
  as axon does not rely on any third-party compiled libraries.

## Running tests

```
$ npm install
$ make test
```

## Todo

  - more tests
  - code cov
  - acks
  - make socket options configurable
  - clean up queue / sock
  - emitter style on top of pubsub with multipart
  - weighted fair queuing
  - use mocha for tests
  - multipart frames
  - cap batch size
  - zero-copy for batches...
  - make batching configurable... disable for lower latency
  - binary support for EmitterSocket (requires multipart)
  - subscriptions
  - ...
